# Multi-page website with Svelte/Sapper.js and Tailwind.css

This is an advanced [frontend mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/myteam-multipage-website-mxlEauvW) I completed partly for portfolio purposes and partly just because I love chomping out UI and web designs, especially with tailwind's utility classes.
